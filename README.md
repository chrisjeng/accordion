# Accordion Music

This is a collection of Panther accordion sheet music, written in a custom.

## Notation Definition:

* `>` or `<` - The direction that your left hand should push the bellows (on a Panther 31 button diatonic accordion, both directions almost always give different pitches).
	* `>` - means you should compress the bellows together.
	* `<` - means you should decompress the bellows apart.
* `H` or `L` - Which pair of buttons your left hand plays.
	* `H` - means you should be playing the two **high**est buttons on the left-most column, where "high" means closest to your left ear.
	* `L` - means you should be playing the third and fourth highest buttons on the left-most column.
* An integer value - Which button your right hand plays. TODO
